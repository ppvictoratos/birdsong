#  Kiklo (Name subject to change)


//TODO:
    
    //Have 3 stationary dots that are blank, user can click into a dot and scroll their spotify (eventually soundcloud & music) account and select a song to be there
    //The album art will populate the dot and upon pressing the dot it will start a stream on the user's device. music will stream in a playlist dictated by the order of the dots (clockwise) the bar at the bottom will have controls
    //Have user profile image open a form modal where a user can upload a few images (scaled & sliding upper half) above their long form writing. If user does not choose to fill it out, upon a viewer click it will just darken on tap
    //Have the playout controls allow changing the song, volume, shuffle?, play/pause
    //Use TCA to set this all up.


//Wendell's thoughts:

    // do TCA first, make sure you get the functionality going
    // talk to Keith after the UI is built out to see what he thinks from a UX perspective
    // having a plus button gives CTA, plus button could expand radially into edit, reorder, add, delete
    // 1st "dot" created starts at 6 o'clock
        // 2nd "dot" created goes to 6, 1st shifts to 9
        // this continues & keeps equal distance between dots

//Things I need to decide:
    
    // What to call each "dot"
    // Is there a limit on how many songs someone can put?
    // How will they be archived? Should it be reset weekly? Weekly based upon date or weekly based upon whenever the user started? I could see a calendar tab that a user can tap into (divided by weeks)
    // a better name than MyMusicBoard (cycles) (kiklo) <3 (shark weekly)
    // make it a weekly thing, calendar based
    // should the image in the middle be a profile image? or an image relating to that week of music
    // each dot should just play the song, pressing the user's image in the middle will open up their "expression form" where the user can upload a few images & some long form writing if they please. This is optional.
    // it would be cool to have user's have a QR code for others to view their profile for that week (or a specific week?)
    
//Future Tings:

    // Have a calendar view that users can view their archived "kiklos"
    // have a server that holds user data and can host more than one user lol
    // have a way to export a "kiklo" to share to other social media platforms (yuck)
