looking to develop the following projects:

- iChing = linux version of iChing 
- 1twothree = unfinished project from college
- 2NiNG = simple audio editor
- 3Strikes = rec softball scorekeeping app 
- FORE4GLE = golf/mini golf scorecard app
- 5..?
- 6PIX..? 
- 7..?
- 8..?
- 9MUSES .. album... and an app?
- Tenp0 = tempo thingy

**20 min a day/every day, all in github.**

Originally, I was going to overwhelm myself and make all of these iOS projects. After finding  a version of the iChing written in Go.. I have decided against just using Swift.
