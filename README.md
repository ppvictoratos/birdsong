looking to develop the following projects:

- iChing
- 1twothree
- 2NiNG
- 3Strikes
- FORE4GLE
- 5..?
- 6PIX..?
- 7..?
- 8..?
- 9MUSES
- Tenp0

**20 min a day/every day, all in github.**

Originally, I was going to overwhelm myself and make all of these iOS projects. After finding  a version of the iChing written in Go.. I have decided against just using Swift.
