//MASTER TO DO LIST:

// Clean up UI so it's not as magic
//Create a Game View that has:

//a mode selector.. sliders?
//what looks the best?
//a difficulty selector
//a start button
//starts out as a whiteboard, with all operators shown

// BY SUNDAY ^^^^^^
// AFTER SUNDAY vvvvv
//a background that changes color based upon mode & generates more
    //operator signs dependent on how difficult
