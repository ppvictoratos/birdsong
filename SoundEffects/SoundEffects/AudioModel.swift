//if I have an AudioState, should I have a visualizer state?
//how does this work then?..
//[||||||.......] loading..
//so i use a view store for all of these models to live in and they communicate through those hallways

//my animation should be implicit based upon the meter levels given by the avaudioplayer
//this means that the audio player should exist where?
//maybe in an animatable struct?

//there needs to be an animatable struct somewhere.
    //maybe make a custom audio timeline view
    //that could animate, using chunked

//make an audio struct? holds the audio data, metering levels, audio files

//make an animating shape that has a bool
//  true will show view
//  false will show another view

//  or should it be true will allow one type of animation
//  and false will be another

//the view it is embedded in will get the animate bool
    //sound should be processed on a background thread
