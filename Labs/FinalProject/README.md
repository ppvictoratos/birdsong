# Final Project - Putting it all together

You have been provided with a base of code which does most of what was required in Assignment 4\. As before, pull the latest code from the Assignments repo into your own repo.

## Problem 1 (basically 10 free points):

1. In Assets.xcassets, as you have done before, add all colors referenced in the code. (you can search for `Color(` to find them. Ensure that all colors work in both dark and light mode.
2. Give your app a unique icon by either creating your own or selecting one from a free collection (google "ios free icons") You may reuse your icon from Assignment 4 if you like or create a new one. NB, you _MUST_ give appropriate credit in your app as outlined in the requirements of the site you use or you must state that you created the icon yourself. Provide the credits for your art work as before in the splash screen using the techniques discussed in class. Failure to do this will result in a failing grade for the assignment and likely the course.
3. Replace the "thumbs down" icon on each tab with a unique icon in the same manner. You may use the SF Symbol app to select appropriate icons for the tab bar items, or you may create your own, adding the icon to Assets.xcassets in a manner similar to your AppIcon. You must give proper credit if you use anything other than SF Symbol.
4. NEW -> Give each tab view (simulation, configuration, and statistics) a separate pastel background color of your choosing, using the techniques shown in class.
5. Ensure that all UISwitches use your accent color rather than the system default.
6. Ensure that the Tab bar uses your accent color as the highlight color for the Tab items.
7. Ensure that the text in your navigation bar uses your accent color for all titles

Essentially these are free points as we are repeating or slightly enlarging on Problems 1-5 from Assignment 4, transferring or improving your work along the way. So you may use code from your previous assignments to do this.

## Problem 2 (40 points):

In the file ThemedButton, change the overlay to use a Circle rather than a Rectangle. Adjust the font and layout of the InstrumentationView so that everything looks nice again. Using the techniques shown in class, adjust your layout for the Simulation tab, so that it works and looks nice in portrait and landscape on the following 3 devices: iPad Pro 12.9", iPhone 11 Pro, iPhone SE (2nd generation).

## Problem 3 (40 points):

In the ConfigurationsView.swift file:

Locate the comment for Problem 3A's beginning. Wrap the existing display in an NavigationView Locate the comment for Problem 3A's end and Problem 3B's beginning. Make the navigation view have a style of StackNavigationViewStyle, a title or Configuration and not be hidden. Do _not_ disturb the comment for Problem 5b which will be appended to your Problem 3B code. In the ConfigurationView.swift file:

locate the comment for Problem 3C. In that location wrap the existing code in a NavigationLink such that when the row is selected, a GridEditor view will appear.

## Problem 4 (30 Points):

In the GridEditorView file:

locate the comment that says Problem 4A. Configure a GridView which uses as it's backing store the grid state of the current configuration and which updates via a grid action on the current configuration state. locate the comment that says Problem 4b. Configure the ThemedButton such that when it is pressed, the SimulationView's grid object in the AppState is updated and the configuration object associated with this GridEditor is updated to match. Verify that pressing the button updates the grid on the simulation tab AND in that if you exit the GridEditor and return that the configuration has been remembered Make sure the the entire page looks consistent with the rest of your app

## Problem 5 (30 points):

In ConfigurationsView:

find the comment marked Problem 5a and implement an ActionSheet which will accept turn on and off with the `isAdding` state and which is turned off via the .stopAdding action. find the comment marked Problem 5b and add a trailing button to the navigation bar which will send the `.add` action to the ConfigurationsState In AddConfigurationView:

find the comment marked Problem 5c and implement the action sheet to allow the user to create a new configuration based on input of the title and size. For size, use the provided CounterView, for title use a TextField.<br>
find the comment marked Problem 5d and implement ok and cancel for the view. find the comment marked Problem 5e and implement keyboard avoidance for the View

## Problem 6 (20 points):

In SimulationView, locate the comment for Problem 6\. Add onAppear and onDisappear modifiers to stop the timer on disappear and restart on appear. Be sure to only have one timer running at any given time.

## Problem 7 (30 points):

Using the techniques shown in class, Implement an animation of your choosing in the GridView such that when the step button is pressed in the InstrumentationView the next step of the grid performs a complex animation. For full credit, your animation should animate the positions, color, opacity, and rotation of cells in a way that is subjectively pleasing to the user.

## Overall rules:

Verify that everything is wired up. In short your Final Project app should substantially resemble what you have seen me demonstrate in class.

We will grade by checking first that you have produced a running version of the app. Non-working code can receive at most 170 points and further deductions will follow from there. You should make any adjustments you feel necessary to produce a working app.

For ease of grading, please do not move code from the file in which is located.

## Grad Student Requirement Problem (50 points):

This problem applies to graduate students only. Undergrads may receive and will be scored on a 200 point basis. Graduate students will be scored on a 250 point total.

Using the techniques shown in class, save and restore the state of the application to User defaults on every change to AppState. Verify that all changes are applied. You may make use of the Codable conformance which has been provided.

## Bonus Points Available (50 points):

You may, at your discretion improve the app in any way you like and submit your improvements for grading. Juan and I will grade your improvements subjectively based on a "Wow" factor. In the past, animations, changes to ThemedButton, interesting modifications to the GoL logic and completely external ideas matching the students interest have qualified for bonus points. We advise you to talk a) make sure you meet the project requirements before attempting anything complex, b) seek our advice on any ideas you have to confirm feasibility.
