I learned about different database paradigms and found `redis` which is a key:val super simple database. Since I have a list of 
hexagrams in CSV form, I was thinking of making it key:val and creating a redis DB for the iChing. 

TODO:

- Get redis
- Learn how to set up a redis DB locally
- Set one up
- Take data and make it into Key:Val pairs (HTH Combo : JSON of hexagram description
- pipe data in redis db
- allow user to enter a combo to get a specific hexagram back
- make a CLT that allows user to get a random hexagram back
- make the hexgram draw with ASCII
