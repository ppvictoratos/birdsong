what i want to do to accomplish making the "iching" as soon as possible is two things.
Set a goal to create a python-written linux script that allows you to HTHTHH each time you
toss the coins. then it shows an ascii picture and the passage. don't worry about the 
turning numbers or whatever. here's what you need to do:

1. Gather info from Wikipedia for documentation and iChing data set
2. Write up the prompt : expected response restraints (only H or T, 6 of them)
3. Using the book, create the 6? elemental thingies using ASCII art
4. Format the final repsonse message
5. Write out the prompt wheel
