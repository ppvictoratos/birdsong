what i want to do to accomplish making the "iching" as soon as possible is two things.
Set a goal to create a python-written linux script that allows you to HTHTHH each time you
toss the coins. then it shows an ascii picture and the passage. don't worry about the 
turning numbers or whatever. here's what you need to do:

1. Gather info from Wikipedia for documentation and iChing data set
2. Write up the prompt : expected response restraints (only h or t, 6 of them)
3. Using the book, create the 6? elemental thingies using ASCII art
4. Format the final repsonse message to be pretty
5. Write out the prompt wheel and test the shit out of it

Req:

This is an example of one:
THTHHT

This is an example of not one:
WEINER

The iChing was a divination tool used back in ancient China. There is an English-translated book by Brian Browne Walker which utilizes 3 coins as the sortition method. As this activity
does require some reflection and journaling, I believe being in the control of the coins
can empower one to take the words and turn them into actions that can really make a change.

64 hexagrams, I have the book with the passages, or i can scrape from da web

2...?

What if I made this data entry?
I allow myself to run this script, and enter my coin results. once done it says
"What hexagram number?"
"What hexagram name?"
"Explain the jist of it"
