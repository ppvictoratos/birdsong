Who is my user? Of iChing?
Someone who is a thinker, maybe into Rick Rubin, Likes the simple things, me. someone who would use the phone as 
a guide to then journal after

What steps will they take to do what they need?
If they are feeling indecisive or need clarity, open the app. it tells you to breathe (optional breathing 
exercise), and it just shows the coins. maybe it shows the last time, which you can click into, it has a note 
section but default text is: we encourage you write in a paper journal! we love trees, but it's better for you", 
coins get added to a cup, cup is shaken, animation rolling, keeps track of what you got, lets you fast forward 
but its mostly about the dice. then afterwards you have some cool art and a blurb about each item..

seems like i'd need permission to transcribe the book. make sense to do that first i guess.. or i can do 
something around that.. maybe we simplify. all coins flip at once, we do short blurbs based upon book, credit it 
in credits. this app needs music.

user is able to quickly toggle dots heads or tails to input real time coin flipping. or you can hit a flip me 
button
